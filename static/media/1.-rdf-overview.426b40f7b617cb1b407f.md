# RDF Overview


---

## What Is RDF?

* Resource Description Framework
* A Data Model for metadata by the W3C
* A Method to describe and exchange graph data
* An RDF Graph consists of Triple Statements

---

## What Are Triples?

![Subject links to object through predicate](./Basic_RDF_Graph.png)

Notes: 1. A Node for the Subject 1. An Edge to represent the arc from Subject to Object 1. Node for the Object Each part is represented by a URI But an Object can also be a literal value

---

## What can a Triple be?

1. Predicates can only be IRIs.
1. Objects can only be IRIs (Named Nodes), Literals (any datatype), or Blank Nodes.
1. Subjects can only be IRIs (Named Nodes), or Blank Nodes.

---

## What is a Blank Node?

A named node is a _shareable_ Identifier.
Blank Nodes are only identifiable internally.

```turtle
<http://example.com/book37> <http://example.com/title> "On the Awesomeness of RDF" .
<http://example.com/book> <http://example.com/contribution> _:b0 .
_:b0 <http://example.com/role> <http://example.com/Author> .
_:b0 <http://example.com/agent> "Smith, John" .
```

Notes: The contribution is specific to the work in question. John Smith may have written other books, but this contribution is specific to this book, so we can use a blank node to represent the specific contribution he had to this work.


---

## What is a Literal?

* Literals are ways of encoding data.
* Literals can be of different data types.
* [XSD: Xml Schema Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C))
** anyURI
** boolean
** date
** dateTime
** double
** duration
** string
** integer
* You can Also incode languages with `rdfs:langString`

```turtle
"hello world"^^xsd:string # strings can also be plan
".09876"^^xsd:double
"2019-09-08T12:13:00.009-02:00"^^xsd:dateTime
```

---

## RDF LangString

* Encode the language of the string to provide internationalization
```turtle
"Hello World"@en
"Halo Welt"@de
"שלום הכולם"@he
```



---

## What about Lists?

An unordered list is easy:

```turtle
<http://example.com/book37> <http://example.com/subject> "Computing" .
<http://example.com/book37> <http://example.com/subject> "Data Structures" .
<http://example.com/book37> <http://example.com/subject> "Cool Stuff" .
```

---

## What about Ordered Lists?

You could have a property like "ordered", but you could also do linked lists.

```turtle
<http://example.com/book37> <http://example.com/toc> _:b0 .
_:b0 rdf:first "Introduction" .
_:b0 rdf:rest  _:b1 .
_:b1 rdf:first "Chapter One" .
_:b1 rdf:rest  _:b2 .
_:b2 rdf:first "Chapter Two" .
_:b2 rdf:rest  _:b3 .
_:b3 rdf:first "Chapter Three" .
_:b3 rdf:rest  rdf:nil .
```

Notes: This example introduces the idea of prefixes to stand in for namespaces

---

## Defining a Data Models in RDF

* RDF provides a set of predicates and classes for the bare minimum of a data schema
* RDFS adds some additional predicates and classes
* Each RDF Data Model builds on these two to create a full data model for a specific
domain
* These data models are the "language" used to describe the data

Notes: the following are some examples

---

## Triples Can have many formats

N-Triples Format

```turtle
<http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me> <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#fullName> "Eric Miller" .
<http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me> <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#mailbox> <mailto:e.miller123(at)example> .
<http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me> <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#personalTitle> "Dr." .
<http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#Person> .
```
---

## Turtle Format

Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language)

```turtle
@prefix eric:    <http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#> .
@prefix contact: <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#> .
@prefix rdf:     <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .

eric:me contact:fullName "Eric Miller" ;
  contact:mailbox <mailto:e.miller123(at)example> ;
  contact:personalTitle "Dr." ;
  rdf:type contact:Person .
```

---

## RDF XML


```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<rdf:RDF
  xmlns:contact="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#"
  xmlns:eric="http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#"
  xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me">
    <contact:fullName>Eric Miller</contact:fullName>
  </rdf:Description>
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me">
    <contact:mailbox rdf:resource="mailto:e.miller123(at)example"/>
  </rdf:Description>
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me">
    <contact:personalTitle>Dr.</contact:personalTitle>
  </rdf:Description>
  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me">
    <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#Person"/>
  </rdf:Description>
</rdf:RDF>
```

## JSON-LD

```json
{
  "http://www.w3.org/People/EM/contact#me" : {
    "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type" : [ {
        "value" : "http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#Person",
        "type" : "uri"
        }

      ],
    "http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#fullName" : [ {
        "value" : "Eric Miller",
        "type" : "literal"
        }

      ],
    "http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#mailbox" : [ {
        "value" : "mailto:e.miller123(at)example",
        "type" : "uri"
        }

      ],
    "http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#personalTitle" : [ {
        "value" : "Dr.",
        "type" : "literal"
        }

      ]
    }
  }
```

## Defining Data Models in RDF

* RDF provides a handful of Classes and Predicates that can be used to define

---

## Mapping OCHRE to Europeana


* OCHRE is more flexible than any specific RDF data model
* OCHRE's property variables are analogous to RDF predicates
* OCHRE treats RDF schema's and vocabularies like languages
* The same OCHRE data can be expressed in multiple RDF schemas

---

## Why RDF?

* Simple
* Flexible
* Expressive
* Shareable

## Europeana Data Model
